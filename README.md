`piri-piri` is the missing tool to test decentralized browser applications. Ah and it's hot! :D

## Problems it tries to solve

Simmultaneous browsers - Most browser testing frameworks (that I learned about), only test one browser at a time, checking for browser incompatibilities that our code might have. The goal of piri-piri is to spawn a how many browsers we want and have them interop between each other, while piri-piri orchestrates them remotely.


Gather information about what happened in the several clients and evaluate the results with external consistency
