> **piri-piri** is an browser orchestration tool in order to test decentralized browser applications. Ah and it is hot :)

**important disclaimer -** This tool is super recent, it has a lot of rough edges and it simply isn't there yet, I will keep developing it because I have a necessity for a tool like this. If you have a scenario where this would be helpful, please share, I would love to hear it and help make it happen!

# Badgers



# Why does it exists


/ / Simmultaneous browsers - Most browser testing frameworks (that I learned about), only test one browser at a time, checking for browser incompatibilities that our code might have. The goal of piri-piri is to spawn a how many browsers we want and have them interop between each other, while piri-piri orchestrates them remotely.

/ / Gather information about what happened in the several clients and evaluate the results with external consistency


# How to use it



# How to run the tests



# Current Issues ( please contribute :) )

## Spawning more browsers

xvfb-run on mac
